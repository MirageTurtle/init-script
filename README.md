# Init script for linux

I'm going to study shell scripting and to build init shell scripts for linux.

Note that, until now, these scripts are for Debian based distros(e.g., Ubuntu) which use `apt` package manager, although I also use Arch and macOS.

Wish me luck!

## Issue

`tools.sh`: No consideration of different distributions or operating systems, and different package management repositories.
